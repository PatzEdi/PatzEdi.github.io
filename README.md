# PatzEdi - Github Pages
This is my website hosted on Github Pages! :)

Update: Redesigned UI

## **I hope you all enjoy what I do and what I will do in the near future. I plan to post a lot more of these useful repositories.**

## **Take a look at the source!**
- I have never really done HTML before, so this was pretty much my first time.
- I learned that it was easy to manage files, which is why I created an assets folder with my assets.
- I chose this specific theme because it was simple for me to do without having much HTML or CSS experience, and it at the same time looks fine.
